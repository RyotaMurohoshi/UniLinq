# UniLinq (Obsolete)

UniLinq was class library for LINQ to Objects on Unity GameEngine without Exceptions related AOT compiler bug.
Unity has AOT compioler bug.
Runtime error happens when we use LINQ method under certain conditions with AOT compiler bug.

Now we use IL2CPP for iOS and other platforms that we used AOT compile on before.
So we can use LINQ safely without AOT compiler bug.

UniLinq becomes Obsolete.
